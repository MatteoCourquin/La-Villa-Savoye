				<h1>News on La Villa Savoye!</h1>

				<p>A 20-minute walk from Poissy train station, come and discover one of the masterpieces of architect Le Corbusier built between 1928 and 1931: the Villa Savoye. It was classified as a historical monument in 1965 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2016.<br>

				A desire for the countryside submitted to Le Corbusier by the Savoye couple gave birth to building. The major innovations dared by Le Corbusier almost a century ago can still and still appear relevant to us.<br>

				A visit is essential to be surprised by this imposing Villa which reflects the modern, avant-garde and futuristic spirit of its architect. Raised in lush greenery, stilts make the aerial construction; the roof-gardens, large windows, the design of the facades and the free plan, as well as the skylights combine to give this Villa an omnipresent clarity. These are all elements that form modern architecture.<br>

				Called the "Heures Claires", Villa Savoye Le Corbusier thus completes the architect's cycle of white villas. Like the other villas in this cycle, it is the culmination of a reflection on the habitat carried out for ten years by the famous architect who wants to offer his sponsors an architecture that is "pure, clean, clean and healthy ‚Äù. You might get inspired for your own arrangements!</p>
