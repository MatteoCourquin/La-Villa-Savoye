        <h1>News on La VILLA SAVOYE !</h1>
        
        <p>A 20-minute walk from Poissy train station, come and discover one of the masterpieces of architect Le Corbusier built between 1928 and 1931: the Villa Savoye. It was classified as a historical monument in 1965 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2016.<br><br>
        
        A desire for the countryside submitted to Le Corbusier by the Savoye couple gave birth to building. The major innovations dared by Le Corbusier almost a century ago can still and still appear relevant to us.<div id="masque1" class="masques"><br>
        
        A visit is essential to be surprised by this imposing Villa which reflects the modern, avant-garde and futuristic spirit of its architect. Raised in lush greenery, stilts make the aerial construction; the roof-gardens, large windows, the design of the facades and the free plan, as well as the skylights combine to give this Villa an omnipresent clarity. These are all elements that form modern architecture.<br><br>
        
        Called the "Heures Claires", Villa Savoye Le Corbusier thus completes the architect's cycle of white villas. Like the other villas in this cycle, it is the culmination of a reflection on the habitat carried out for ten years by the famous architect who wants to offer his sponsors an architecture that is "pure, clean, clean and healthy ”. You might get inspired for your own arrangements!</p></div>

        <h1>A UFO named Savoye</h1>
        
        <p>You have to imagine the landscape in the 1930s. Poissy, a peaceful little town with its bell tower and stone houses. In the heights, a plateau bordered by fields and orchards stretching to the Seine. There, in the middle of this bucolic setting, a white cube, as if placed on the grass, looks like a UFO. This is the Villa Savoye.
        Imagined by Le Corbusier (see elsewhere), it will be one of the purest examples of modern architecture. So much so that the building, like all the work of its designer, was classified in July as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A museum dedicated to this visionary is due to open there in 2020.<br><br>
        
        It was in 1928 that Eugenie and Pierre Savoye, a wealthy Parisian couple asked Charles-Edouard Jeanneret, better known <div id="masque2" class="masques">under the pseudonym of Le Corbusier, to build him a residence in the countryside. "Mrs. Savoye had spotted it while visiting the Villa Church, in Ville-d'Avray, which belonged to friends", explains David Madec, administrator of the building managed by the center of national monuments. The couple almost give him carte blanche, simply outlining the family's needs. With its stilts, its facades pierced with long windows and its garden roofs, the result detonates. Even more, it is a true manifesto of modernity that Le Corbusier imagined. The grand staircases, the chandeliers, the woodwork of classical architecture have disappeared. Thanks to the reinforced concrete, the load-bearing walls are eliminated. The light is everywhere. A solarium is fitted out. Exit the maids' rooms on the top floors, here, the staff is housed on the ground floor to come and go without disturbing the Savoye.</p></div>

        <h1>Villa Savoye submerged in a Danish fjord</h1>
              
        <p>Already vandalized in the photomontages of Belgian artist Xavier Dolory, the Villa Savoye is now drowning in the fjord of Vejle (Denmark). Or rather its replica, designed by Asmund Havsteen-Mikkelsen for the Floating Art festival which takes place opposite the Fjordenhus, the first building designed by the artist Olafur Eliasson, since June 23. Presented until September 2, this 1: 1 scale reconstruction hijacks Le Corbusier's most famous building to express a critique of our time, in the light of the modernist<div id="masque3" class="masques"> utopia that emerged at the start of the 20th century.<br><br>
              
        When it was built in Poissy (Yvelines), between 1928 and 1931, the villa of the Savoye couple embodied all the precepts of the modern movement. With its stilts, roof terrace, banded windows as well as its plan and free facades, this living machine symbolizes the "promise of a new world" according to the Danish artist. A new era which places rationality and the aspiration for a better life for all at the top of the scale of values, unlike our present, punctuated by Brexit, the election of Donald Trump or the rise of extreme parties -right…</p></div>

        <h1>Yvelines. Guided tours, artistic residency, new work: things are happening at Villa Savoye de Poissy</h1>
                
        <p>Guided tours from the garden, choreographic creation filmed on site and visible on Francetv Culturebox, new edition of a book ... The Villa Savoye in Poissy (Yvelines) does not forget its audience, even if the interior of the villa remains closed, confinement requires.<br><br>
        
        Famous house designed by architect Le Corbusier, Villa Savoye de Poissy has been closed to the public since the end of October. Nevertheless, the site, managed by the Center des monuments nationaux, offers several news items for the attention of the public.<div id="masque4" class="masques"><br>
        
        The first is to organize guided tours on site, but only from the garden. Who was it built for? What are the 5 points of this new architecture? How is it emblematic of Le Corbusier's work? Here are some of the questions that will be addressed by the guide on the occasion of the next visits scheduled for Saturday April 17 and Sunday April 18 at 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.<br><br>
        
        Other news, the public is invited to discover the choreographic creation signed Amala Dianor, accompanied by the dancer Nangaline Gomi, in the heart of the Villa Savoye. On the occasion of a collaboration with the visual artist Grégoire Korganow behind the camera, Amala Dianor adapts the choreography of her show Man Rec (Me only, in Wolof) and transposes it into Nioun Rec (We only), the first creation of a series of dance films entitled Ciné-Danse. From urban dances to contemporary dance through African dances, Amala Dianor seizes the Villa Savoye and merges styles. The result can be found on the Francetv Culturebox website.</p></div>

        <h1>Exhibition in Poissy: animal and human presences haunt the Villa Savoye</h1>
        
        <p>The National Monuments Center which manages the Savoye villa in Poissy (Yvelines) is presenting the Living in the Villa exhibition, until January 24. This is a carte blanche given to Françoise Pétrovitch, artist, 56 years old and living in Cachan (94). For the occasion, she created around fifteen works, paintings and sculptures, which interact with the architecture and chromatic research of Le Corbusier.<br><br>
        
        Considered one of the flagships of the Modern Movement, the Villa Savoye takes advantage of architectural polychromy, a strategy of relating colors to spaces, designed by Le Corbusier. Using this same range of colors and adjusting the dimensions of the works to the format of the architecture, Françoise Pétrovitch<div id="masque5" class="masques"> prolongs the architect's gesture and follows in those of Eugénie Savoye, the villa's sponsor in 1928. All of the works works are part of architecture, inhabits it, even haunts it with animal and human presences.<br><br>
        
        The route begins with the vestibule on the first floor where the visitor is greeted by a bouquet painting in a vase, placed unceremoniously on the shelf. Further on, the son's bedroom receives, in the alcoves, two paintings of adolescents, in ambiguous attitudes, between idleness and worry. Around the bathroom, along the tub, the bronze sculpture of a boy surrounded by a buoy creates a vibrant contrast of materials. As an extension, the boudoir is decorated with a painting of a bird and ceramic gloves sketching games of hands in front of the window.<br><br>
        
        Continuing out onto the terrace, Jane, a black bronze sculpture, arms raised and surrounded by a belt of plants, glows darkly in the white light of the solarium. Finally, the kitchen also spares its curiosities, such as the octopus placed in ambush in the sink, the languid cat on the worktop and the plate in the serving hatch.<br><br>
        
        The artist’s familiar world (flowers, adolescents, animals) repopulates the villa. Standing right on the edge of the imagination, the works inspire a sensitive way of inhabiting.</p></div>
